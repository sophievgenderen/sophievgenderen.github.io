## About Me

My name is Sophie van Genderen. I am an international student from the Netherlands studying at DePauw University in Indiana. I am a rising senior majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Business Administration. I plan on graduating May 2021.

## About My Mentor

My mentor is Professor Odest Chadwicke Jenkins, who is a Computer Science faculty member at the University of Michigan. Professor Jenkins mainly focuses his research on autonomous robotics for mobile dexterous manipulation of objects and robot learning from human demonstration. Here is a link to his research videos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0Dw9tJ_j_k5Vse2bnpDfEZO4XnCVpvcW

## About My Project

This summer I am working in Professor Jenkins' research group and the project we will be working on will explore ways to teach building  an omni-drive robot platform and its autonomous pathfinding to first-year undergraduates. During the summer, I will be working on the programming for pathfinding for the project.
