During my first week of doing research we mainly talked about what this summer would entail and what exactly we would be doing. We had to do some research on path planning. I looked at a lecture Professor Jenkins sent, and did research on different planning and graph-search algorithms such as Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm and the A-Star Algorithm. I also refreshed my knowledge on binary search. Since A-Star would be an important search algoithm in our research project, I put more time into looking into that algorithm in order to fully understand it.
